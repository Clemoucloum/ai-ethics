# How to contribute?
Thank you for considering contributing to our project! Here are a few guidelines to follow:

# Getting Started
You can always navigate to the [`guide.md`](./guide.md) file in our repository. Feel free to add any information regarding AI and Ethics in that file. Either update the existing categories or create a new one that does not exist, both are welcome!

When contributing media content such as images or videos related to AI and Ethics, please ensure to place them in the media/AI/ directory. Follow naming conventions that reflect the content, use common formats for images (e.g., JPEG, PNG, SVG), and preferred formats for videos (e.g., MP4, WebM). Don't forget to provide proper attribution for external content and optimize media files for web use while maintaining visual clarity.
